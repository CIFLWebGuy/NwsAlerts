Arctic air continues to move off\nthe Alaska mainland and over the relatively warm water of the\nBering. Thus, the atmosphere will continue to be moistened and\ncontribute to snow shower development through this evening as the\npattern remains stagnant.\n\nWind gusts ranging from 30 to 40 mph this morning will slowly\nsubside to 20 to 30 mph by this evening. As a result, any falling\nsnow combined with the gusty winds could reduce visibility to as\nlow as one half mile at times. Locations that continue to be\nimpacted by these adverse conditions include False Pass, Port\nHeiden, Cold Bay, Dutch Harbor, and Saint Paul.\n\nWidespread snow shower activity throughout the morning and into\nthe afternoon will become more isolated in nature during the\nevening.",
